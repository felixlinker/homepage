# Projects

## Current Research & Work

* [A Formal Analysis of the iMessage PQ3 Messaging Protocol](https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/)
* At the IETF, I am an author of the [Key Transparency Protocol draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-keytrans-mcmillion-protocol/) as part of the keytrans working group
* [An Authentic Digital EMblem (ADEM)](https://emblem.felixlinker.de) in collaboration with the *International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)* (*published at CCS23*)
  * ADEM was covered publicly in a news article by [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en/news-and-events/eth-news/news/2023/11/digital-emblem-for-humanitarian-law-in-cyberspace.html) and I gave an interview to [Deutschlandfunk](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/wie-sich-hilfsorganisationen-gegen-hacker-schuetzen-sollen-int-felix-linker-dlf-2eec799e-100.html) (German).
* [SOAP: A Social Authentication Protocol](https://soap-wg.github.io/) (accepted at USENIX Security 24)
* Currently, I work on applying *cyclic proof rules* to [Tamarin](https://tamarin-prover.github.io/) such that it can handle looping protocols and recursive data structures better.
More soon!

## RISC-V Formal Analysis

I wrote my [Master thesis](https://github.com/felixlinker/ifc-rv-thesis) on information flow tracking in instruction set architectures as a follow-up to my work at Arm Security Research.

## Automated Reasoning

During my studies, I was working as part of the Chair for Intelligent Systems at Leipzig University where I wrote my [Bachelor thesis](/doc/agm_contraction_ba.pdf) in theoretical computer science on abstract argumentation.
This thesis turned into my first [publication](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-19570-0_3) later.

## Bachelor in Philosophy

As part of studying a Bachelor's in philosophy, I wrote my [thesis (in German)](/doc/ba_platon.pdf) about two works of Plato: the *Republic* and *Phaido*.
I investigated how the fields of ontology, normativity (or ethics), and epistemology are linked in his philosophy.
