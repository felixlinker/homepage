# Projects

In my work at ETHZ, I am part of the Centre for Cyber Trust[^1] where I mostly work on a digital emblem for humanitarian services in collaboration with the *International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)*.
You can find more details about this project [here](/adem).

To find out more about my coding experience, I encourage you to look at my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/felixlinker).
There, you will also find a link to my [Master's thesis](https://github.com/felixlinker/ifc-rv-thesis) on information flow tracking in instruction set architectures.
I wrote this thesis as a follow-up to my work at Arm Security Research.

Before that, I was working as part of the Chair for Intelligent Systems at Leipzig University where I wrote my [Bachelor's thesis](/doc/agm_contraction_ba.pdf) in theoretical computer science on abstract argumentation.
This thesis turned into my first [publication](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-19570-0_3) later.

As part of studying a Bachelor's in philosophy, I wrote my [thesis (in German)](/doc/ba_platon.pdf) about two works of Plato: the *Republic* and *Phaido*.
I investigated how the fields of ontology, normativity (or ethics), and epistemology are linked in his philosophy.

As part of my hobbies, I maintain https://coriolis.io/ which is a fan-made ship-builder for the space game [Elite: Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/).
