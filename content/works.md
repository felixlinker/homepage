## Industrial Benchmark for Fuzzy Particle Swarm Reinforcement Learning

### Description

This was a project to benchmark the approach to controller policy optimization proposed by *Hein et al., 2017* called *Fuzzy Particle Swarm Reinforcement Learning* (FPSRL).
I applied the *Industrial Benchmark* (IB) to that approach thereby following a methodology the authors themselves used to benchmark a similar approach in *Hein, Udluft, Runkler, 2018* which followed the same idea but used genetic programming instead of particle swarm optimization.
I wrote the code to benchmark that approach in python.

## AGM-Style Contraction in Dung-Logics for Argumentation Frameworks

### Description

This is my bachelor thesis and all about [Argumenation Frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_framework) and the [AGM theory of belief revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_revision).
I enhance on [the works of R. Baumann and G. Brewka](https://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~baumann/papers/ijcaiBR.pdf) who gave implementations for expansion and revision in Dung Logics for Argumentation Frameworks.
I show that there is no contraction operator in Dung Logics.

## Facebook Network Analysis of News Pages

### Description

In the winter semester 2016/17 I was the leader of the project "Facebook Network Analysis of News Pages" as part of *Introduction to Digital Humanities*.
We tried to investigate the claim that most people experience facebook only in their filter-bubble/echo-chamber.
By using data open to access via the facebook Graph API and storing it anonymously in a graph database using [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/), we found that there are indeed such filter-bubbles that are closely linked to parties found in the german parliament.

## TWIG

### Description

In 2016 I modelled and developed a [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework)-benchmark generator that aims at providing the user with a pseudo-random true-to-life RDF-dataset to test RDF-algorithms with.
It can be configured via a seed and simulates twitter the results of which are stored in RDF.
