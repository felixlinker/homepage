My name is Felix Linker, I was born in Flensburg, Germany, and am currently studying at the University of Leipzig, Germany.

### Educational path

In 2014 I finished my A level with an average grade of 1.0 at the *Altes Gymnasium Flensburg*.
Then I started to study B.Sc. Computer Science and B.A. Philosophy at the University of Leipzig, Germany.
In 2017 I finished my B.Sc. Computer Science with an average grade of 1.2 after which I continued studying M.Sc. Computer Science.

### Experiences

#### AKSW

In 2016 I worked half a year for the research group AKSW.
There, I got into the concepts of RDF and OWL.

#### cookionista

After that I worked for cookionista until March of 2018 where and applied BPMN to Wordpress by building a Wordpress plugin to edit, store and execute BPMN models assisted by a CMS.

#### Arm

From September to December 2018 I worked as an intern in the security group of the research department at Arm Ltd in Cambridge.
I helped to start a project to formally verify the specification of the microcontroller of the Arm architecture.
You can find an overview over that project in the paper _"Who guards the guards? Formal Validation of the ARM v8-M Architecture Specification"_ by my supervisor Alastair Reid.
