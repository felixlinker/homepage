I am Felix E. Linker, a PhD student in the [Information Security group](https://infsec.ethz.ch/) at ETH Zurich.

## Research Interests

I focus on protocol analysis and design using formal methods.
As part of the [Centre for Cyber Trust](https://infsec.ethz.ch/research/projects/cyber_trust.html), I strive to bring stronger security guarantees to people in their everyday life.
To assure that those are *guarantees*, I back my claims by formal methods and improve the tools whenever I hit a limit.

Recently, I have been working on a digital emblem for humanitarian services in collaboration with the *International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)*.
I worked on authentically marking such services so that they do not become accidental targets in times of war.
You can find more details about this project [here](/adem).
As part of this work, I came across the problem of verifying recursively defined models in the protocol verification tool [tamarin](https://tamarin-prover.github.io/), which I am working to improve right now.

Find more details about my research in my dissertation's research plan [here](https://github.com/felixlinker/research-plan/releases/).
