This is my bachelor thesis about Argumentation Frameworks and non-monotonic reasoning.

This is my bachelor thesis and all about [Argumenation Frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_framework) and the [AGM theory of belief revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_revision).
I enhance on [the works of R. Baumann and G. Brewka](https://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~baumann/papers/ijcaiBR.pdf) who gave implementations for expansion and revision in Dung Logics for Argumentation Frameworks.
I show that there is no contraction operator in Dung Logics.
