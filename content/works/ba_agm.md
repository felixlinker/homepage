title: "Bachelor's thesis: AGM-Style Contraction in Dung-Logics for Argumentation Frameworks"
date: 2017-09-05

In the summer of 2017 I wrote my bachelor's thesis for Computer Science.
It was  all about [Argumenation Frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_framework) and the [AGM theory of belief revision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_revision), i.e. formal logics, knowledge representation and non-monotonic reasoning.

I enhanced on [the works of R. Baumann and G. Brewka](https://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~baumann/papers/ijcaiBR.pdf) who gave implementations for expansion and revision in Dung Logics for Argumentation Frameworks.
I was able to show that there is no contraction operator in Dung Logics.

Although my result was a negative one, the chair of Prof. G. Brewka offered me to turn the results of this thesis into a paper for publication.
You can find more details on this [here](/works/jelia).
