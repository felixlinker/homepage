In the summer of 2018 I wrote my second bachelor's thesis - this time it was for my studies of Philosophy.
It was about two works of Plato: the *Republic* and *Phaido*.
I investigated how the fields of ontology, normativity or ethics and epistemology are linked in the philosophy of Plato.

I wrote this thesis in German but if you still are interested in its content, you can find a download link below.
