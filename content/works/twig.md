In 2016 I modelled and developed a [RDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework)-benchmark generator that aims at providing the user with a pseudo-random true-to-life RDF-dataset to test RDF-algorithms with.
It can be configured via a seed and simulates twitter the results of which are stored in RDF.
