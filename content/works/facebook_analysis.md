In the winter semester of 2016 I was the leader of the university project "Facebook Network Analysis of News Pages" as part of *Introduction to Digital Humanities*.
We tried to investigate the claim that most people experience facebook only in their filter-bubble/echo-chamber.
By using data open to access via the facebook Graph API and storing it anonymously in a graph database using [ArangoDB](https://www.arangodb.com/), we found that there are indeed such filter-bubbles that are closely linked to parties found in the german parliament.
