In July of 2018 I authored my first commit to the open source project [*coriolis*](https://coriolis.io/).
coriolis is an online service maintained by the players of the MMORPG-style space-sim [Elite: Dangerous](https://elitedangerous.com).
It allows players to plan how they want to equip and modify their space-ships and give them detailed statistics.
It's a plain front-end JavaScript project that is written with React.

In October of 2018 the team of coriolis decided that the code-base needed a major re-work.
This is why I started *ed-forge* which is a TypeScript library that handles all the logic of coriolis and is meant to serve the community of Elite: Dangerous as a backbone for any services that deal with loadouts of space-ships.
