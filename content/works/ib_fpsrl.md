This was a project to benchmark the approach to controller policy optimization proposed by *Hein et al., 2017* called *Fuzzy Particle Swarm Reinforcement Learning* (FPSRL).
I applied the *Industrial Benchmark* (IB) to that approach thereby following a methodology the authors themselves used to benchmark a similar approach in *Hein, Udluft, Runkler, 2018* which followed the same idea but used genetic programming instead of particle swarm optimization.
I wrote the code to benchmark that approach in python.
