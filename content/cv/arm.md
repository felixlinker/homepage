From September to December 2018 I worked as an intern in the security group of the research department at Arm Ltd in Cambridge.
I helped to start a project to formally verify the specification of the microcontroller of the Arm architecture.
You can find an overview over that project in the paper _"Who guards the guards? Formal Validation of the ARM v8-M Architecture Specification"_ by my supervisor Alastair Reid.
