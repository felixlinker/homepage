My name is Felix Linker, I was born in Flensburg, Germany, and am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Leipzig, Germany.
I am passionate about formal verification and how to make it more accessible for everyone - developers and companies.
My enthusiasm for formal methods arose during an Internship at Arm Ltd.
I continued this work in my master thesis on model checking and instruction set architectures.
