# An Authenticated Digital EMblem (ADEM)

I have been working on ADEM as part of my work within the Centre for Cyber Trust together with [Dennis Jackson](https://dennis-jackson.uk/) and my supervisor, [David Basin](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/basin/).

In 2020, the [ICRC](https://www.icrc.org/) reached out to the Centre and asked us to investigate the possibilities of a *digital emblem*.
An emblem that would transfer the properties of the physical emblems, the red cross, crescent, and crystal, to the digital realm.
The purpose of such a digital emblem is to mark digital entities, e.g., servers belonging to a hospital, as protected under international humanitarian law (IHL).

As a response, we designed ADEM.
ADEM allows to actively mark any kind of digital, network-connected entity as protected under IHL.
ADEM was designed to be practical: it applies to a wide range of digital entities, is backwards-compatible with the existing internet's infrastructure, and copes with the realities of international diplomacy where consensus is notoriously hard to reach.

David and I wrote a [blogpost](https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2021/09/21/legal-protection-cyber-warfare-digital-emblem/) on ADEM for the ICRC.
Also, we are working on open-source specification for ADEM which can be found [here](https://adem-wg.github.io/adem-spec/).
This specification is work-in-progress.

[This blogpost](https://blogs.icrc.org/law-and-policy/2021/09/16/legal-protection-digital-emblem/) details the ICRC's view on the digital emblem, including a stronger legal background.
