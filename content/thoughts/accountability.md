# The Case Against Accountability

Accountability is a great security property, and its value can be seen most clearly in Certificate Transparency and Key Transparency.
In both these systems, accountability aims to strengthen authenticity.

Certificate transparency augments the Web PKI and key transparency key servers, e.g., of messaging applications.
Both the Web PKI and key servers aim to provide you with authentic public keys.
In case of the Web PKI, these keys are brought to you via certificates, signed by certificate authorities.
In case of the key server, these keys are brought to you via (well) the key server.
In both cases, the trust placed in certificate authorities or the key server is substantial and it would be easy for any of these authorities to cheat.

## Accountability & Liveness

* Accountability is a liveness property
* Accountability doesn't let us reduce to assumptions ("MY DOG STOLE MY KEYS!")
